Command-line SNMP tools
=======================

This repo is the old name for the collection of command-line SNMP tools
written in pure-Python. The tools mimic their famous
[Net-SNMP](http://sourceforge.net/projects/net-snmp/) counterparts.

The new name for the package and the repo is [snmpclitools](https://github.com/etingof/snmpclitools).
